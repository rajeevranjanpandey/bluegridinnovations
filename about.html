      <h2>About BlueGrid Innovations</h2>
      <p>
        BlueGrid Innovations is a technology-driven startup focused on bringing smart, affordable automation solutions to middle-class households. Our mission is to conserve water, optimize electricity usage, and enhance home intelligence using IoT-based devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Founded with the vision of making automation accessible, our products are designed with a "plug-and-use" philosophy—easy to install, low maintenance, and effective. We combine embedded systems with cloud technologies to ensure our users are always connected with their homes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our first flagship product, <strong>TankiFi</strong>, addresses the common issue of water wastage due to tank overflows. With TankiFi, users can monitor water levels in real-time and receive alerts when the tank is full.
      </p>
      <p>
        BlueGrid Innovations continues to explore solutions in areas such as automated plant watering systems, smart lighting, and energy-efficient appliances to help build the homes of tomorrow.
