    <h2>About BlueGrid Innovations</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>BlueGrid Innovations</strong> is a future-focused technology startup committed to making smart automation accessible to middle-class households. Our core mission is to simplify everyday life by integrating intelligent, eco-friendly solutions into homes — helping users conserve water, save energy, and live smarter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our approach blends simplicity and innovation. All our products follow a <strong>“plug-and-use”</strong> design philosophy — they are easy to install, require minimal maintenance, and seamlessly integrate with modern lifestyles. From smart hardware to real-time cloud connectivity, our systems are built with precision and purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our flagship solution, <strong>TankiFi</strong>, addresses the widespread problem of water wastage caused by overflowing tanks. Using wireless sensing and live display units, TankiFi enables households to monitor and manage their water usage like never before.
    </p>

    <p>
      Building on that momentum, we launched <strong>PlantGuard</strong> — an intelligent plant-watering assistant that ensures timely hydration of your plants, even when you're away. Whether on your balcony, terrace, or indoors, PlantGuard automates daily care, so your green friends always thrive.
