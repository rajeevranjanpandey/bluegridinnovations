    <h2>About BlueGrid Innovations</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>BlueGrid Innovations</strong> was born from a simple idea to make everyday living smarter and more sustainable for every household. As engineers and tinkerers at heart, we saw how small inefficiencies like water overflowing from tanks were costing families time, money, and precious resources. So, we decided to do something about it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our mission is to bring intelligent, easy to use automation into the hands of ordinary people. Whether it’s managing your water more wisely or helping your plants stay hydrated while you're away, our products are built to fit seamlessly into your life no complex setups, no tech expertise required.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our first product, <strong>TankiFi</strong>, helps families track their water tank levels in real-time, putting an end to overflow and guesswork. Building on that momentum, we created <strong>PlantGuard</strong> a smart watering assistant that keeps your balcony or indoor plants healthy, even when you’re not around.
    </p>

    <p>
      At BlueGrid, we believe in solving everyday problems through technology that feels personal. We blend our love for embedded systems and automation with a deep focus on user experience, sustainability, and impact. Whether it's smarter lighting, more efficient energy use, or intelligent home safety we're building for a better tomorrow, one idea at a time.
