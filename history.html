  <h2>Our Journey</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>BlueGrid Innovations</strong> was born out of a blend of curiosity, engineering grit, and a vision to solve real-world problems faced by Indian households. Founded by an electrical engineer and researcher from <strong>IIT Kharagpur</strong>, the journey began during undergraduate days filled with hands-on projects, tech fests, and a growing passion for automation and sustainable solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    The idea struck while observing a common yet persistent issue — water wastage from overflowing tanks. Every home, whether urban or rural,dealt with this silently. What started as a weekend project evolved into <strong>TankiFi</strong>: a smart, wireless water-level monitor designed to prevent overflow and conserve thousands of litres annually.
  </p>

  <p>
    Encouraged by the positive response, BlueGrid grew into a platform for purposeful innovation. We ventured into plant care automation, energy-efficient lighting, and low-cost home automation — always with one goal: <em>to build for the people who truly need it</em>.
  </p>
   

  <p>
    Today, BlueGrid Innovations continues to combine embedded systems, IoT, and intuitive design to create solutions that are affordable, efficient, and ready to use — tailored for middle-class Indian homes.
