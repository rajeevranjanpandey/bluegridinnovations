  <h2>Our Journey</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>BlueGrid Innovations</strong> began with a mix of curiosity, engineering spirit, and a deep desire to solve everyday problems in Indian homes. The founder, an electrical engineer, and researcher from <strong>IIT Kharagpur</strong>, discovered his passion through hands-on projects and tech fests during his undergraduate years. That energy soon turned into a drive to build solutions that matter.
  </p>

  <p>
    The spark came from a simple observation so much clean water was going to waste every day due to tank overflows. It was something nearly every household faced, yet no one talked about. This inspired the creation of <strong>TankiFi</strong>, a smart and wireless water level monitor that helps families avoid waste and manage water use with ease.
  </p>

  <p>
    The warm response from early users showed that thoughtful, practical innovation could truly make a difference. From there, BlueGrid became a space for solving real challenges. We expanded into plant care automation, smart lighting, and cost-friendly home solutions always with one mission in mind: <em>build for those who need it most</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today, BlueGrid Innovations continues to explore new ways to simplify life. By combining embedded systems, intuitive design, and connected technology, we create solutions that are easy to use, affordable to own, and built with care for the everyday Indian household.
