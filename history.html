      <h2>Our Journey</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>BlueGrid Innovations</strong> was founded with a simple idea: to bring smart, affordable automation into every Indian home. It all started when we observed how water gets wasted daily due to overflowing tanks — a problem seen across every city and village.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our founders, with backgrounds in engineering and a passion for sustainability, developed the prototype for <strong>TankiFi</strong> — a small yet powerful device to monitor and prevent water overflow from overhead tanks.
      </p>

      <p>
        From there, BlueGrid Innovations expanded into other product ideas like smart irrigation systems, energy-efficient outdoor lighting, and affordable home automation solutions for the middle class.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, we continue to innovate with the mission of making life easier, homes smarter, and resources better managed for every family.
